## Wenguang Wang’s Homepage

I’m Wenguang Wang, currently a Master candidate in the Institute of Computer Science & Technology of Peking University ([ICST](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/)), also a member of Character Shape Computing Lab ([CSCL](http://59.108.48.27/cscl/)).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tiemobuguilu/tiemobuguilu.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tiemobuguilu/tiemobuguilu.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
